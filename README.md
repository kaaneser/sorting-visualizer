## Features

- Visualization of various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
- Generating a random array or sorting a user-defined array.
- Adjusting the speed of the sorting process.
- Navigating step-by-step sorting process.
- Verifying the sorted result array.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following requirements:

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kaaneser/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Install utils module 
   ```
   pip install utils
   ```
4. Run project
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
## Usage

1. After opening the project, the sorting visualization interface will be displayed.

2. Use the dropdown menu in the top left corner to select a sorting algorithm.

3. You can click the "Randomize" button to generate a random array. Additionally, you can manually arrange the array by clicking on each bar.

4. Click the "Sort" button to start the sorting process.

5. While the sorting process is ongoing, you can adjust the speed using the "Speed" slider. Choosing "Slow" allows for clearer visualization of each step, while "Fast" executes the steps more quickly.

6. You can navigate forward and backward through the step-by-step sorting process using the forward and backward buttons.

7. To verify the sorted result array, click the "Validate" button.
